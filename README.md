This project delves into an in-depth exploration of the Californian housing market using data derived from the 1990 census. Through robust analysis techniques, it investigates the intricate relationships between various factors influencing housing prices, focusing on income levels, geographical coordinates, and housing age distribution. The project aims to validate correlations between median_income and median_house_value, analyze the impact of proximity to urban centers on property values, and uncover patterns in housing age distribution across California. The findings offer valuable insights for real estate professionals, policymakers, and individuals seeking a deeper understanding of housing trends and dynamics in the region.
